    <p><strong>Compliance notice:</strong> CapstoneReady is a preparation/training support app and is not a Registered Training Organisation (RTO).</p>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>This policy explains how personal information is handled in CapstoneReady in an Australian context, aligned with the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>

    <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sign-in identifiers and account profile details from selected providers (Apple, Google, Facebook, Email).</li>
      <li>Learning progress data including attempts, scores, readiness, and module completion.</li>
      <li>Weekly profiling records, including recipient emails and supervisor sign-off fields.</li>
      <li>Notification center and messaging metadata used for inbox sync, signature workflow, and tutorial reminders.</li>
      <li>Premium entitlement state from Apple StoreKit.</li>
      <li>Tutorial booking data (for example topic, tutor details, session time, and status events).</li>
      <li>Operational diagnostics required for support and app stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Why we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide app access and features.</li>
      <li>Track progress and training preparation outcomes.</li>
      <li>Deliver profile export/distribution to the signed-in learner and linked employer.</li>
      <li>Support separate SRTO/RTO portal workflows only where subscription, learner consent, and backend authorization are valid.</li>
      <li>Activate and validate purchased premium access (currently a non-renewing 10-week pass).</li>
      <li>Support notifications and workflow events across profiling, messaging, and tutorial booking.</li>
      <li>Maintain security controls and service quality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Storage and security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Progress/profile records are stored locally on device.</li>
      <li>Sensitive local payloads are encrypted at rest with Keychain-backed key handling where available.</li>
      <li>Periodic device presence verification checks are enforced during signed-in sessions (biometric where available).</li>
      <li>We apply reasonable safeguards against unauthorised access, loss, and misuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Sharing and disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information. Data may be disclosed only where required for app operation, configured delivery services, or legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>6. Profile data access restrictions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Direct profile PDF delivery is restricted to signed-in learner and linked employer recipients.</li>
      <li>SRTO/RTO access is restricted to subscribed, consented, and authenticated portal workflows.</li>
      <li>Any SRTO/RTO use or storage without prior written permission from Spark's Capstone Ready and an active paid RTO subscription is prohibited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Third-party links</h2>
    <p>The app may open external services such as YouTube links for tutorial content. Third-party platforms operate under their own privacy policies and terms.</p>

    <h2>8. Premium and RTO subscription separation</h2>
    <p>The learner premium pass and any future RTO portal subscription are separate products. A learner premium purchase does not grant RTO portal access, and an RTO portal subscription does not grant learner premium entitlements.</p>

    <h2>9. Access, correction, complaints</h2>
    <p>For access/correction/complaints: <strong>capstoneready@outlook.com</strong>.</p>
